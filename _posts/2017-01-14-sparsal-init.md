Two weeks ago I started coding an implementation of the Matching Pursuit algorithm, by St√©phane Mallat and Zhifeng Zhang.
This led to creating the Sparse Approximation Library - sparsal, for people looking for some of the algorithms, 
implemented in a human-readable, functional style.

# Overview 
I came across the Matching Pursuit algorithm during an internship at INRIA - Bordeaux. Matching Pursuit is a greedy algorithm that decomposes a signal into "atoms" from an overcomplete dictionary, also called atomic decomposition. It is a valuable tool for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. One of its extension (an orthogonal version), the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, is mainly used for generating sparse approximation of signals.

The goal of sparsal is to provide students and general users an "easy" introduction to sparse approximation methods, writen in a functional style and easy to debug, modify and play with. Every implemented algorithm is written in a "naive"-way, without any attention paid to performance. Nonetheless, optimized implementations of some algorithms (like [MPTK][mptk]) will be available eventually.
