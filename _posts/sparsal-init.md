Two weeks ago I started coding an implementation of the Matching Pursuit algorithm, by St√©phane Mallat and Zhifeng Zhang.
This led to creating the Sparse Approximation Library - sparsal, for people looking for some of the algorithms, 
implemented in a human-readable, functional style.

#Overview
I came across the Matching Pursuit algorithm during an internship at INRIA - Bordeaux. The fruits of the internship can be 
found in [this][paper] non-published article.
<br>
The goal of sparsal is to provide students and general users an "easy" introduction to sparse approximation methods.
